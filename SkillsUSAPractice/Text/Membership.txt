For 36 years, the Merrimack River Watershed Council has worked to preserve and protect our natural resources.  We’ve advocated for clean drinking water and a safer river, and promoted wildlife conservation.  We’ve taught hands-on education courses for children, families, and adults, and led kayaking trips from the mountains to the sea. Now we are at a crossroads.  In order to sustain our important work, we need continued and significant support from our community – from you, our members and friends.

Take a minute to think about what the Merrimack River means to you.  If you want to drink clean water, enjoy a safer river, and preserve the Merrimack for your children’s children – we need you to act today by joining or renewing your membership.

We offer memberships at the following levels:
Student - $15
Individual – $35
Family – $50
Extended Family – $75

As a MRWC member, you can expect to receive our e-newsletter (email required) along with discounts on our programs. You will receive full voting privileges at our Annual Meeting, which we hope you’ll attend! And in the coming months, we are excited to unveil additional members-only benefits, including exclusive event invitations.
