About the Merrimack River
 The Merrimack River is formed in central New Hampshire by the confluence of the Pemigewasset and Winnipesaukee Rivers. Spanning the two states of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, the watershed is the fourth largest in New England (5010 square miles). The river flows for 115 miles from Franklin, New Hampshire to the coastal city of Newburyport, Massachusetts.  The watershed is comprised of seventeen smaller subwatersheds. A subwatershed is an area from which groundwater and surface water drains and contributes to flow in another body of water.

Today, two million people and 204 communitities reside in, and depend upon the watershed. The Merrimack River is the only major river in New England that serves as a direct source of drinking water.

The Merrimack River and its tributaries have helped shaped the lives of everyone and everything in the Merrimack Valley since the Native Americans arrived here almost 8,000 years ago. The River and its watershed is a vital natural resource supporting us, wildlife, and plants.

Many Native American Indian tribes once occupied the watershed and gave the river a number of different names.  The most well known Indian name is merruasquamack, which means “swift water place,” and is believed to have originally applied to the portion of the river between Garvins Falls in Bow, NH and Pawtucket Falls in Lowell, MA.  Today, the river is known as the Merrimack.
